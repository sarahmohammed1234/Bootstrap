## Bootstrap Project 
npm i bootstrap-icons
We were asked, during the first week of the summer training at Qassim Panorama Company, an individual task, which is to study and 
complete the Satr platform course on full stack JavaScript. We were asked to complete the first seven tracks of the course,
which were about (html, css, Bootstrap, DOM, JavaScript101-102-103) And sending the projects that are within each track after 
that (some tracks did not include projects), we were given a grace of five days to understand the course and send the projects.
