## Bootstrap Project ðŸ’œðŸ§©ðŸ’œ

We were asked, during the first week of the summer training at Qassim Panorama Company, an individual task, which is to study and 
complete the Satr platform course [https://satr.codes] on full stack JavaScript. We were asked to complete the first seven tracks of the course,
which were about (html, css, Bootstrap, DOM, JavaScript101-102-103) And sending the projects that are within each track after 
that (some tracks did not include projects), we were given a grace of five days to understand the course and send the projects.
